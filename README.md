# Observation submission form for the Mason Farm Butterfly Project

## Note: We haven't published our dataset yet, so for now you can see the app live on my [shinyapps.io account](https://kaugustine.shinyapps.io/googleform/).

###This is a R Shiny app that is still in development as a custom observation submission form for the Mason Farm Butterfly Project. I'm still figuring out how to host it on a UNC server before it can go live on the [project's website](https://ncbutterflies.web.unc.edu/) but it's been a fun project that I wanted to share and document here for my research lab. I will update this code as I make changes.
